        <h1>Logo vs Identity vs Brand</h1>
        <p><b>1. Logo</b> is a mark that identifies the brand. 
            A logo's job is to promote instant public recognition.</p>
        <p><b>2. Identity or visual Identity</b> dictates all the ways the brand appears to your audience.
        <br>Identity is a package of visual devices that an organization uses to communicate the brand, such as graphic imagery, a color system, fonts and a logo.
        The system may or may not also include collateral such as stationery, brochures and signage, plus written content such as key messages and a positioning statement.</br></p>
        <p><b>3. Branding is the relationship people have with your company</b> Marty Neumeier states in his book The Brand Gap, “A brand is a person’s gut feeling about a product, service, or company. It’s not what YOU say it is. It’s what THEY say it is.”</p>

        <p><b>Towards the end</b> <p>Chris starts talking about how to get the client to say if my logo is in the right direction. 
            When it comes to a design/marketing brief (tells you what the project about and what is trying to be achieved.</p>
            <p>1.- Can you simplify the marketing brief in 5 words or less? If you can BAD because that means it means nothing.</p>
            <p>2.- Break it up into 2 words like (serious and fun) it's good to pick words that are opposites to each other, because there's a lot in each spectrum but little that overlaps serious and fun together because then it's easier to nail what the client wants.
            Ask lots of questions, give the client lots of words until they can agree with 2.</p>
            <p>3.- After getting the words I go away and make a mood board, basically go on Pinterest/Behance and pick things that show serious fun to me. I show the client and ask them if I'm going in the right direction.
            Way better than if you work thousands of hours and they don't like it.</p>
